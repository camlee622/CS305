Software Security


The client for this project was Artemis Financial and their goal was to have a product with effective security features such as a checksum verification, file and data verification and dependency checks.

I feel like one thing I did extremely well was generate and export and certificate with a password that gets encrypted for the project. Coding securely is a critical part of being a good software developer. It's the ethical thing to do, especially in a case where sensitive information is handled. Having proper security provides essential value to a company because of the benefits to it's clients, which reflects on the work that the software engineers put in. 

The vulnerability assesment overall went smoothly, however I did have issues loading up the server on my localhost. One issue I had was ports that had been taken. So, I had to go through cmd.exe and view which ports were being used, clear them up, test the code, repeat. 

I increased layers of security using an algorithm cipher, generating a certificate with a unique passcode, performed a dependency check, and manually reviewed the code.

Using the previous mentioned methods helped me determine that the code was functional and secure. I reaffirmed that the code maintained it's functionality and didn't introduce new vulnerabilities by performing two dependency checks on the project. One before the refactor, and one post-refactor. 

One major resource I used, specifically with getting the localhost server running was Stack Overflow. There were people with similar issues/questions as myself that helped guide me towards getting the server to work. 

From this assignment, I would like to show future employers that I am capable of generating a certificate and implementing proper security features using alogirthmic encryption. Although not every software role will revolve around everything covered in this assignment, I think having that sense of purpose for good security is a good responsibility to understand and have under my belt.
